  Structured Query Language (SQL) (pronounced /ˌɛsˌkjuˈɛl/ S-Q-L; or
  alternatively as /ˈsiːkwəl/ "sequel") [4][5] is a domain-specific language
  used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system
  (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data
  incorporating relations among entities and variables.Introduced in the 1970s,
  SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or
  VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one
  single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a
  record, i.e., with or without an index.
