<p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It's maintained by the Django Software Foundation and is free and open source. Django follows the model-template-views (MTV) architectural pattern, which is similar to the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. It is primarily used for backend web development, handling tasks such as data modeling, URL routing, and templating. </p>
