<p><strong>Java</strong> is a popular programming language that was created by <strong>James Gosling</strong> in 1995 while he was working at Sun Microsystems. It was designed to be <strong>Simple</strong>, <strong>Secure</strong>, and <strong>Platform-Independent</strong>, meaning it can run on different types of devices without needing to be changed. Java is widely used for building websites, mobile apps, and enterprise software. Today, it remains one of the most important programming languages in the world.</p>
